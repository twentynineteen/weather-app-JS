# weather-app-JS

This is a weather app based on the tutorial from Brad Traversy's "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning", using the VisualCrossing API instead of WUnderground.

It uses the weather icon set available from the Visual Crossing GitHub page.

Brad's tutorial uses the city and state variables for location but as i'm based in the UK, I've changed it to City and Country.
